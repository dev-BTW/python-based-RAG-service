The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936. The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled\u00c2 by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together\u00e2a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism. Drawing on the boys\u00e2 own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times\u00e2the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs. ...more\nProduct Information\nProducts you recently viewed\n-\nThe Coming Woman: A ...\n\u00c2\u00a317.93\nIn stock\n-\nThe Dirty Little Secrets ...\n\u00c2\u00a333.34\nIn stock\n-\nThe Requiem Red\n\u00c2\u00a322.65\nIn stock\n-\nSapiens: A Brief History ...\n\u00c2\u00a354.23\nIn stock\n-\nSharp Objects\n\u00c2\u00a347.82\nIn stock\n-\nSoumission\n\u00c2\u00a350.10\nIn stock"}, {"url": "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/nonfiction_13/index.html", "text": "Worlds Elsewhere: Journeys Around ...\n\u00c2\u00a340.30\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a340.30\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a331.05\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a326.41\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a323.11\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a344.18\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a331.12\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a316.77\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a337.13\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a356.06\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a341.83\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a319.83\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a322.00\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a354.35\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a329.14\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a330.81\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a343.54\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a338.21\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a317.24\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a338.49\nIn stock\n\u00c2\u00a312.23\nIn stock"}, {"url": "http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/category/books/politics_48/index.html", "text": "Books to Scrape\nWe love being scraped!\nHome\nBooks\nPolitics\nPolitics\n3\nresults.\nWarning!\nThis is a demo website for web scraping purposes.

There is the first voyage to the moon in a balloon, republished for the first time since 1820 that further tells of a darkness machine and a lunarian named Zuloc. Other sci-stories include the first robotic insect and an electricity gun.
